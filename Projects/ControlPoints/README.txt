This is a solution inteded to be a replacement of the add-in trimble points from Trimble. The main interactions here are: set a family-type nested in a hanger and them choose the parameters that will be used as ID or any other data that you want to capture. The add-in will export two files, one with internal coordinates and other with shared coordinates,
along with the data that you've choose to be exported for each instance of the family type.
